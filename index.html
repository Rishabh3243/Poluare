                "Pollution"</h1>
                Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.
                Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat, sound, or light). 
                Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. 
                Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally implies that the contaminants have 
                an anthropogenic source that is, a source created by human activities. Pollution is often classed as point source or non
                point source pollution. In 2015, pollution killed nine million people worldwide.
                Major forms of pollution include air pollution, light pollution, litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution, 
                soil contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, visual pollution, and water pollution.
